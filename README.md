# Django-Expert

## https://proyectoropa.herokuapp.com/erp/dashboard/



This is a big Django project that simulates an inventary stock of a cloth store. You can login and play with it to see how dynamic is.

This is how (briefly) the project works


*I will not show the scripts since it is part of a set of projects that I plan to sell in the future.*

Some of the technologies of the project:
1. AWS S3 bucket, for store the product images.
2. SQL queries for a better performance of the Django Models.
3. A lot of JS and React, for better dynamism of the dashboard.
4. Login and logout for security reasons.
5. Instant connection between forms and graphs, for a real time dashboard.
6. The project allows payments in installments, charging the installments automatically in the corresponding months.
