This is a big Django project that simulates an inventary stock of a cloth store. 
You can login and play with it to see how dynamic is it (clicking dropdown you'll access all the options).

This is how (briefly) the project works

And this is a visual of how big is the project tree (It's imposible to show all the tree):

*I wonÂ´t share the scripts since it is part of a set of  personal projects.*

Some of the technologies of the project:
1. Heroku for free hosting and their GIT repo.
2. AWS S3 bucket, for store the product images.
3. SQL queries for a better performance of the Django Models.
4. A lot of JS and React, for better dynamism of the dashboard.
5. Login and logout for security reasons.
6. Instant connection between forms and graphs, for a real time dashboard.
7. The project allows payments in installments, charging the installments automatically in the corresponding months.

And a lot more!
